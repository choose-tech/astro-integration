# Working with comparisons

## Running the site locally

To run this website locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `18.14.1`. We recommend using something like `nvm` to manage node versions. Once installed, enable Corepack using `corepack enable`. It will install PNPM for you.

Start by installing the dependencies with `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`, then start the local server with `pnpm dev`. That's it!

## Resources

Resources are split into 2 types: categories and libraries. They are located in the `content` directory.

See the schemas [here](../packages/integration/collections.ts).

### Categories

### Auto-generated resources

`github` and `npm` collections are autogenerated for caching purposes. You don't need to do anything with them, they are excluded from Git.

### Making sure entries are valid

Astro takes care of the validation. If you want some realtime feedback, run `pnpm dev`. Otherwise, if you want to check it the content is valid afterwards, just run `pnpm build`.
